### Summary
In this repository, we use **three different approaches** to create staking contracts.

---

#### Approach 1:
Issues users an ERC-20 token based on the time they are staking ETH.

#### Approach 2:
Locks the tokens for the user during withdrawal for **21 days**.  
Users donâ€™t receive the new token during this period.
